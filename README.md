# ConfuseSystems
All of my systems using the de.confuse package

<h1>What is the point of this repository?</h1>

These are small systems I made for myself and might come in handy for other people too.
This repository contains Array, String and List utility classes to make your life a little bit easier :).<br>
<br>
This also contains and replaces a lot of classes and repositories I wrote over the years and were useful so I included them here.<br>
